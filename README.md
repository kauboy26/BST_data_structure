# C data structures library
There are a couple of data structures here. I may use these in some of my other
projects. There aren't tests written for all of them, so if you want, please
write some tests.

## BST
There's a generic BST here. Unfortunately, I haven't written any tests
for it yet. Use it at your own risk.

## Stack
This stack can only hold integers. It is backed by an array. The tests
for it exist, and I think they're fairly exhaustive.
